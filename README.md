# Google-Search-Automation

As a software engineer, we have to google a lot of stuff and everytime we have to open chrome and manually search. This can be made less time consuming with the help of a python script with which we can access google search right from the terminal and the search results will be filtered according to the websites we mention in the code. The python script uses the python modules `webbrowser` and `sys` to automate google search right from the terminal.
